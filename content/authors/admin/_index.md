I am a first year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences, Tsinghua University](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/about/). My advisor is [Chongjie Zhang](http://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~zhang/).

My research interests lie in reinforcement learning and probabilistic methods for machine learning. I have worked on topics including offline reinforcement learning, score-based generative models, and approximate inference.

I received my B.E. from the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Tsinghua University, where I was fortunate to work with [Jun Zhu](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jun/index.shtml), [Guy van den Broeck](https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~guyvdb/) and [Stefano Ermon](https://cs.stanford.edu/~ermon/).
